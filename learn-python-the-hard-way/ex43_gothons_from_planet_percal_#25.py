a process to use when  to build something using Python, 
with object-oriented programming (OOP).

1. Write or draw about the problem.
2. Extract key concepts from 1 and research them.
3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts.
4. Code the classes and a test to run them.
5. Repeat and refine.

The way to look at this process is that it is ”top down,” 
start from the very abstract loose idea and 
slowly refines it until the idea is solid and something you can code.
